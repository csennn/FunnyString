# FunnyString
This code is a solution to the problem of determining whether a given string is "funny" or not. The program takes an input string and first converts each character in the string to its ASCII value, storing the values in an ArrayList. It then creates a reversed version of the original ArrayList, and checks if the absolute difference between consecutive ASCII values in the original and reversed lists match. If they do, the string is determined to be "funny" and the program returns "Funny". If not, the program returns "Not Funny". The solution is implemented in Java and uses various features such as ArrayLists, collections, and streams.
